# Using VBA to Conduct Stock Market Analysis

## Overview of Project
For this project, I helped Steve create a program to analyze a set of stocks for 2017 and 2018. Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications, or VBA, was used to complete this effort. We initially looked at a stock his parents had interest in "DQ" but we soon realized this stock was underperforming. DQ shares witnessed losses of 63% in 2018 making it the worst performing stock in an underwhelming market. We expanded the scope of our analysis to include 11 additional stocks which informed our ultimate recommendation to **Buy ENPH**!

## Results

We recommend that Steve's parents buy ENPH. If one is looking only at **Figure 1**, he or she may determine that buying RUN is the smarter move because its return of 84% leads the market. However, if one looks at **Figure 2**, he or she will see that RUN actually saw one of the smallest gains at 5.55%. In this same year, ENPH did very well by ending the year **+129.52%**. Over the two years, ENPH had the greatest returns. However, the case with DQ serves as a cautionary tale that past success is not indicative of future returns.

## Summary

Re-factoring this code was not a simple task. It was a frustrating and challenging process. "Why am I spending so much time 'fixing' a functioning program?" crossed my mind more than once during the project. Yes, there was concrete evidence that the re-factoring process decreased the amount of time it took for the program to run, but I was interested in greater returns that I uncovered upong further reflection.

### Pros of Re-factoring
1) The code is *cleaner* and thus easier to read and understand. This makes working in teams a smoother, more effective process.
2) The re-factoring process uncovers bugs that would otherwise be less apparent.
3) The re-factoring process speeds up processes. Reducing lag and processing times is a omnipresent challenge and this applies to both simple tasks and complex programs.

### Cons of Re-factoring
Re-factoring does have some drawbacks, however, beyond being a frustrating process for novice programmers.
1) Re-factoring code does take time, and in the commercial world, time means resources and money. Most businesses seek to reduce operating costs, but this is especially critical for start-ups working with limited capital. Although re-factored code is more robust and adaptable, if re-factoring the program would lead into missed deadlines and budget overruns, re-factoring efforts may need to be limited or delayed until time and funding factors allow for the team to re-factor the existing program.

In the case of re-factoring the Stock Analysis program, I did not face time or budget constraints. Additionally, the clunky nature of the first code, without tickerIndex, provided ample incentive to re-factor this program, although it was functional in its unrefined form. The benefits go beyond a shorter processing time. Additional features and analysis can be applied to this set of stocks more easily and efficiently by utilizig the re-factored codes and indices.
