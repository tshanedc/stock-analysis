# Using VBA to Conduct Stock Market Analysis

## Overview of Project
For this project, I helped a friend create a program to analyze a set of stocks for 2017 and 2018. Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications, or VBA, was used to complete this effort. We initially looked at a stock his parents had interest in "DQ" but we soon realized this stock was underperforming. We expanded the scope of our analysis to include 12 stocks on the *Trillogy Industrial Average.

VBA was very helpful in conducting this analysis, as it allowed for us to automate the analysis in a repeatable manner, so if we have access to additional datapoints, we will be able to easily extract valuable insights. Removing **magic numbers** was a game-changer, as the utility of our program expanded drastically. Magic numbers are those which, without looking at the program, seem to magically appear because they have been manually inserted on the developer-end.
